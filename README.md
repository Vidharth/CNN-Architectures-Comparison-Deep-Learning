# CNN-Architectures-Comparison-Deep-Learning

This project was done as a part of the Deep Learning course in the University of Groningen.

The main contributors of this project are: Hari Vidharth and Ashwin Vaidya. 

This project compares popular CNN architectures that won the Image Net Competition (ILSVRC).

Not all of them were compared, only a few hand picked ones.

The dataset used for this taks in the intel image classification dataset.

Please read the research paper included for details on the experiments conducted and the results obtained.
